You might not know, but I really like python for it's simplicity. I have given some courses on it to digital artists and engineers because it's a great language to understand how a computer receives instructions. Here is a little snippet I'm using to try the Syntax Highlighting in [Jekyll][jekyll].

{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name)
    print("Hi, "+str(name))

print_hi('Tejón')
# prints 'Hi, Tejón' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

I'm learning Jekyll on the go, but it seems to have that simplicity I like so much about python.
