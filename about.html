<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>
  I'm a Computer Systems Engineering, working my way into science. Lead by curiosity, I have been driven to places and knowledges of many different areas. From scenic arts, to software engineering; Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to watch and learn from giants. I find myself exposed and attracted to many areas of science and technology. I've focused on using the little I know to create and share experiences.
</p>

<h2>What do I do?</h2>
<p>
  I'm no stranger to Spanish, German, specialized areas of biosignals, social engineering, philosophy, psychology, pedagogy, and some other more unusual areas of knowledge. I love to explain things to kids and adults, and that has made me quite a good science divulgator.
  I'm also a web developper in training so, if you'd like to see my work you can check it out in my github: <a href="https://github.com/abcsds">abcsds</a>
</p>

<h2>Why a blog?</h2>
<p>
  I'm a believer of information openness, and social equality. I want to take information and technologies to wherever they're needed, and openning my notes is a good start. I also like promote discussion of science and technology outside the academic environment, and that's just what a blog is.

<h2>So... why the name?</h2>
<p>
  A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombic_hexecontahedron">Rhombic Hexecontahedron</a> is a 60-sided stellation of a rhombic triacontahedron (I know, it's super clear now!). Just picture a star-like figure where every spike is formed by three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rhombus">golden rhombi</a>. It is one of my favorite shapes, and has much more than physical beauty to offer. It looks a bit like this:
