<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>
  I'm a current student of the Computer Systems Engineering Bachelor, at the <a href="http://www.ingenierias.ugto.mx/DI/estructura/">Guanajuato University</a>. Lead by curiosity, I have been driven to places and knowledges of many different areas. From scenic arts, to software engineering; Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to watch and learn from giants. I find myself exposed and attracted to many areas of science and technology. I've focused on using the little I know to create and share experiences.
</p>

<h2>What do I do?</h2>
<p>
  I'm no stranger to Spanish, German, specialized areas of biosignals, social engineering, philosophy, psychology, pedagogy, and some other more unusual areas of knowledge. I love to explain things to kids and adults, and that has made me quite a good science divulgator.
  I'm also a web developper so, if you'd like to see my work you can check it out in my github: <a href="https://github.com/abcsds">abcsds</a>
</p>

<h2>Why a blog?</h2>
<p>
  I'm a believer of information openness, and social equality. I want to take information and technologies to wherever they're needed, and this is a good place to star. My notes might sometimes not be very clear, and could even be useless to your particular case, but don't be afraid to ask me if something seems foggy.

<h2>So... why the name?</h2>
<p>
  A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombic_hexecontahedron">Rhombic Hexecontahedron</a> is a 60-sided stellation of a rhombic triacontahedron (I know, it's super clear now!). Just picture a star-like figure where every spike is formed by three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rhombus">golden rhombi</a>. It is one of my favorite shapes, and has much more than physical beauty to offer. It looks a bit like this:
