# Hello World!
Hi! I'm a young engineer in computational systems trying to learn [Jekyll][jekyll]. You could say I'm a fan of github for it's incredible way of building communities. Since github suggests Jekyll for their pages, I figured I'd give it a try.
It is not the first time I learn something by doing, and I'm quite sure I'll be doing websites on Jekyll in no time.
If you'd like to see some of the things i've learned like this you can checkout my [github][github].
